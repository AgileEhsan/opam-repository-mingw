OCaml version 4.03.0 is now officially supported. There are four different switches:

- `4.03.0+mingw32`
- `4.03.0+mingw64`
- `4.03.0+flambda+mingw32`
- `4.03.0+flambda+mingw64`

You can also install the pre-compiled binaries by adding a suffix-`c` to the
switch, e.g `opam switch 4.03.0+mingw64c`. Bootstrapping is much
faster this way, but the binaries might not work any longer, if the
maintainers of the cygwin repository update their mingw64-gcc packages.
